🌸 Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning)

This project is part of the AI & Machine Learning Internship tasks.
The objective of Task 1 is to build a supervised machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their physical features.

📌 Problem Statement

Given the measurements of an Iris flower:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The task is to predict the correct species:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica

🧠 Approach & Methodology

Used the Iris dataset provided by scikit-learn
Applied Logistic Regression for multi-class classification
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Trained the model and evaluated its performance

🛠️ Technologies Used

scikit-learn
NumPy

📊 Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:
Accuracy score
Confusion matrix
Classification report

Result:
The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, indicating excellent class separation and learning.
Proper use of datasets and evaluation metrics
Clean, readable, and reproducible code
Well-documented results and explanations
